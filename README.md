Template code to make a sweet Wolfram web app

These files are pretty well annotated but it is basically a single html file named index.

The index.html contains an iframe that displays a Wolfram Cloud url. This is the result of CloudDeploying a function in the Wolfram Language. This will provide users an opportunity to wrap their cool Wolfram function in a good looking webpage.

This template uses iframe code, however if you go to LookLike.Ai you can see a drag'n'drop method used for Images with does look smoother and lead you to have a results page. By navigating to tumblr.com/blog/wolframlang and looking up the post on the making of LookLike.Ai you can learn how to make it yourself using Wolfram API code instead of CloudDeploy
